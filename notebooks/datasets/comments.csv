"you guys clearly changed the terms in your website for the VIP pass, i used the wayback machine to verify 🙄",negative
Lol yall complain too much,positive
LMAOOOO THE CLOWNERY. DAH TAK LAKU BARU NAK BUKAK SINGLE DAY PASS 🫢,negative
Why do u guys do this!! Yall said theres not gonna be any 1 day VIP passes in the website so but now there is?? this feels like a scam i regret buying the 3day vip passes early 🙃,negative
"hi organizer, this is not fair. those who bought 3 day passes in phase 1 thought that would be the cheapest even tho some of them r really just targeting a certain band. now suddenly, ur releasing a single day pass and at such prices, certainly those who targeted a certain band would benefit this single day pass. this is a scam i can say. pls let us know how we can file a complain. they shud be given an exchange option or a refund if they feel dissatisfied about this. organizer are getting dirty money, ur reputation will definitely be impacted by this in the future. i can surely say u guys wont last for another few years",negative
"Anak2 sekalian, dari awal lagi GVF ada inform dekat website for 1 day Pass. You guys overlooked la ni. But indeed for VIP passes nampak tak fair dekat situ sebab tiba2 je announce ada pulak 1 day pass utk vip. Sebelum ni memang takda, maybe takramai yg beli tix la tu. So pergi la u all tengok lineup perform hari apa di website ya.",positive
How is this fair for the early ticket buyers. You better be joking GVF,negative
You announced previously there will be no VIP single passes so we bought the VIP 3 day passes and now this is what we got from you????? Releasing VIP single day passes??? Making VIP designated area very crowded with those VIP single passes??,negative
"At this point. Yang masih complain harga yahudi tu, it’s on you dude. Been to multiple concerts/festivals the past years and considering the number of artist performing in a day. The ticket pricing is roughly around average. 3 day pass complain, 1 day pass pun complain. You ppl are never satisfied.",positive
kau tutup phase 1 and bukak single day pass right after without giving direct info about lineup schedule. kalau org tak tgk website sah2 duduk termenung pilih hari mana nak beli tiket. dahla buat tiket limited. kalau yg 3 day pass tu limited aku faham. ini yg sepatutnya diutamakan kau buat limited. nampak tak merapu?,negative
Bruh expensive af,negative
HOW IS IT FAIR FOR THOSE WHO PAID 1.5K FOR VIPS JUST FOR YOU TO ANNOUNCE SINGLE DAY PASSES FOR VIP??? MAKING VIP AREA NOT EXCLUSIVE AND CROWDED WITH THOSE SINGLE PASSES???,negative
Suka hati lah nak complain ke tk or tk puas hati. Duit sendiri. Comment dibuka so up to us wanna give feedback or not lol. Crazy the amount of people hating on us just bc we complain about their strategy 🙄,negative
Damn I should’ve just bought Single Day VIP Pass 🙂,negative
I am the fans of GVF .😉😉 But I get a problem is that I wanna buy single day pass however I already bought the 3days pass. Is there any way I can refund？ Because I want to go to GVF very much but when I bought the 3days  the website  didn't show any info about single day pass.,negative
LIST OF WHICH ARTIST PLAYING ON WHICH DAY IS ON THEIR WEBSITE GUYS!,positive
Some of us bought the vip 3-day passes because you announced earlier there will be no vip single day passes and today you’re releasing vip single day passes???? What a joke!,negative
Hekeleh haritu ckp xde vip,negative
"KORANG NI SEMUA TAK KENA LAH PENING DORANG NI NAK MELAYAN. Hari tu nak sangat one day pass, sekarang dah ada complain mahal lagi, habis tu nak drg jual berapa??? RM 150?

Worst management stupid venue overpriced ticket,negative
Aku dah beli phase 1 😂 otsyzyzkgxkgxgxhcuckgzktzktzkgxgk,negative
"TF, vip now can be purchased as single day pass ? Totally misleading and scam. People bought to feel exclusive with such a price but now people will crowded in there during big acts performing day. Just same as GA pass. Dont mind about GA single day pass because you do it previously but VIP single day pass ? Oh man what are you think",negative
Siapa yang dah beli General Admission phase 1....riot! 😂 Jk it's all good,positive
This should be price for 3days. 😪 changed venue next gvf plss.,negative
"3 hari layan konsertt jem la, saya dtg nak tengok the strokesss je❤️",positive
Sorry I confused sikit kenapa orang complain phase 1 dgn single day pass. Kalau dah beli phase 1 cam lagi untung je sebab dapat terus 3 hari. And kalau beli phase 2 pun still untung dari daily pass?  maybe depends on which artist korang nak tengok kot eh?,positive
Anyone know when will dpr perform ?! 😭,positive
Organiser this is absurd,negative

The website previously mentioned no single dah VIP. Now what is this mannn???,negative
Finally,positive
"If this is your attempt at trying to prove you’re not a money hungry organizer then you’ve clearly failed MISERABLY. Don’t come on here to try and justify single day VIP passes as “providing accessibility” when this is plain and simple a quick cash grab. You’ve not only failed to entice potential skeptical customers, you’ve also just successfully lost ALL support from your original paying customers. Shame on you Good Vibes",negative
Complainnnnn..!!!!!,negative
"buto la sial, dah beli phase 1 tix,last last ada 1 day pass . ko ingat yang mengkomen komen tu nak beli ke? komen je lebih tak beli pun.",negative

"Korang nak apa sebenarnya? Annoying lah. Demanded single pass. Dah dapat. Harga yahudi pulak dah. Then dont go lah. This isn’t a concert. A music festival is where u discover and explore music. Whether the music vibes with u or not, that’s preference based lah nanti. Payah ah semua tak kena.",negative
"Yang good vibes ni pun satu hal, u r digging ur own grave betul. Stick to what you have mentioned. If anything, yall reduce the price je lah it will still save your ass 💀",negative

Please don’t complain about the price… if there were no amazing International artists people would be complaining that the line up sucks also …so these festival organizers can never really win can they…😔 if they charge lower prices and get less quality acts… people would also complain.,negative
The RM is weak and these overseas artists won’t lower their rate just because the currency isn’t strong.,positive
